This example demonstrates a subtle issue in Groovy related to using the 'return' statement within a closure used by the 'each' method on a list.  The 'return' statement inside the closure does not exit the entire method, but only exits the current iteration of the loop.  This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're expecting it to immediately terminate the whole method. The solution shows a corrected approach to achieve the intended behavior.
